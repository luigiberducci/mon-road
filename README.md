# Mon-Road
Library for monitoring of traffic metrics using STL.

# Installation
Run the following command to install the dependencies 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, with Python3.8.

# How to run
I will try to keep a minimal set of examples to show how to use this library.

See the examples:
- `examples/example_lon_safety.py` implements a simple offline monitor for RSS1 (*Longitudinal Safety*)
